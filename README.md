## General Information
- People can have different scars and mole in their body however they are confused on whether its doing any harm to their body or can they be ignored with this model the user will be able to recognize if they have something that require greater attention other wise leading to the fatat disease.
- Here we are using the set of around 2K image dataset belonging to the different types of cancer diseases.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The model being trained with the limited neorons and few Convolution layers doesnot seems to be performing well and is mostly overfitting which also means that we might have to increase the input size and have to train the model over larger images dataset to get the better recognition
